# TokenShield

Origin:
If your private key is stolen and you donâ€™t know it, hackers will usually arrange a "scavenger" program to monitor your account, and then wait for an opportunity to eat the assets in your account, no matter what you deposit in this account ETH or other tokens still received an airdrop.

So how can the account assets be safely transferred without being snatched by the "scavengers"?

The Token shield tool provides us with another way to put transactions from external accounts on the chain without paying gas fees, and simply use funds in another account to "bribish" miners.

We do not need to transfer a sum of ETH to the hacked address as a handling fee, and we can withdraw the tokens from this address. We will use funds in another account to pay transaction fees, so there is no need to have ETH in the hacked account, so that we can safely transfer assets without phishing.

Features:
- Support any ERC20 token rescue function
- More functional testing
